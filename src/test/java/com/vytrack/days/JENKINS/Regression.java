  To run feature files in parallel without limiting number of threads:
        CHECK README.MD file
        Because of this configuration, it will run parallel
        since we have parallel configuration, if I run multiple feature file, will it also run it parallel?
            but scenarios in same feature file will not run parallel.

<parallel>methods</parallel>
